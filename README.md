# How it works:
###
### **Color-Code**
- **RED** indicates the *start cell*.
- **GREEN** indicates the *target cell*.
- **BLACK** indicates an *obstacle*.
- **ORANGE** indicates the *path* that was found by the algorithm.
- **WHITE** *nothing* is set.


### **Options**
- Click on **Set Start-Point** to set the start cell.
- Click on **Set End-Point** to set the target cell.
- Click on **Set Obstacle** to set obstacles.
- Click on **Reset Grid** to clear the whole grid.
- Click on **Generate Obstacles** to generate some random obstacles.

### **Mouse**
- Press **Left-click** on a specific cell to change it. 
- -> Cell will be changed to the type that you choosed beforehand. Initial type is *start cell*.
- Press **Right-click** on a specific cell to reset it. 
- -> Cell will be reseted to white.

### **Pathfinder**
- Press **A-Star** to start the pathfinding algorithm.
- -> *Start cell* and *target cell* has to be set.
- -> The shortest path will be colored in **ORANGE**
